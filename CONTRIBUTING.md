Thank you for your interest in contributing to Pimo!

We welcome contributions of all kinds: bug fixes, documentation, packaging help, tests, and feature PRs.

Before you open a PR
--------------------

1. Search open issues and PRs — someone might already be working on the same change.
2. If you're adding a feature, open an issue first to discuss the approach.
3. Keep changes small and focused. Small PRs are easier to review and land.

How to contribute
-----------------

- Fork the repo and create a branch for your changes: `git checkout -b feat/my-feature`
- Make changes and run the app locally to verify behavior: `npm install` and `npm start`.
- Commit with clear messages and push to your fork.
- Open a PR against `main` and include a description, screenshots, and rationale.

Code style & testing
--------------------

- Keep UI changes minimal and consistent with the existing design.
- If you add logic that benefits from unit tests, please include them and describe how to run them in the PR.

Issue triage and labels
-----------------------

- Use the provided issue templates for bugs and feature requests.
- Contributors with merge rights will review, request changes, and merge when ready.
